FOREWORD 

The Digest of Public General Bills appears in response to the increase of appropriation 
for the Legislative Reference Service, fiscal year 1936 (49 Stat. 471). The committee report 
on that bill (no. 869) indicates the purpose of the increase as follows: 

“ Ten thousand dollars . . . to enable the Legislative Reference Service to furnish to Senators and Representa- 
tives a weekly digest of introduced and reported bills and resolutions. . . . The purpose is not to present a complete 
and detailed study of bills but to furnish in the form of a brief synopsis the essential features of the introduced 
public bills and resolutions and a little fuller digest of reported measures in order that Members may have a 
weekly file from which they may follow the legislation when introduced and from which they may readily 
answer correspondents concerning these measures.” 

Publication of the Digest began with the second session, cumulating all public general 
bills and joint resolutions introduced, and including measures pending from the first session, 
upon which action short of approval had been taken. This first-session material was carried 
in the first three numbers, after which it was limited to bills actually reported, etc., during 
the current session. Extended digests were dropped when the bills involved were approved, 
and a mere note of the approval substituted. This final issue picks up the digests of first- 
session bills dropped from Nos. 4-10, and is therefore cumulative of all the preceding numbers, 
except that the more detailed digests of bills subsequently approved have not been carried over.
