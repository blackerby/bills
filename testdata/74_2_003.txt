persons acting in concert, without authority of law, for the killing or injuring of persons in custody charged 
with or convicted of crime, with the intent or consequence of depriving them in any way of the protection 
of the laws). 

§ 2. Makes the failure of a State or subdivision to protect any individual against a mob, whether by 
way of preventing or punishing the acts thereof, a denial of due process of law within the meaning of the 
Constitution. 

§ 3 (a). Makes it a felony punishable by fine of $5,000 or 5 years’ imprisonment, for a State or local 
officer charged with the duty either of protecting any person from a mob, or of prosecuting members of a 
mob, to fail to make “all diligent efforts” to perform his said duty. 

(6). Makes it a felony punishable by imprisonment from 5 to 25 years, for a State or local officer having 
legal custody of a prisoner to conspire (1) with a member of a mob, to injure such prisoner, or (2) with 4 
any person, to allow the prisoner to be taken from his custody; same penalty on the persons conspiring 
with the officer. 

§ 4. Gives Federal district courts jurisdiction to punish members of mobs (in accordance with State 
law) when it is shown (1) that the responsible local officers have failed to prosecute (delay of 30 days being 
prima facie evidence of such failure); or (2) that the jurors obtainable for the proper State court are so * 
biased that there is “probability” that the guilty persons will not be punished in such court. 

§ 5. Makes any county in which any person is injured or killed by a mob [committee amendment—• 
because of the failure of the responsible State officers to perform their duty] liable in damages (from $2,000 
to $10,000) recoverable in a civil action by the United States district attorney in the Federal district 
court for the district where the crime occurred, and enforceable by execution upon county property,

severally liable in damages, as provided in § 5. Authorizes Federal district judges to designate place 
within their districts for prosecutions under the act.
