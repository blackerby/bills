S 379. Mr. King; January 7, 1935 (Immigration). 
As reported without amendment June 7, 1935—Calendar No. 881: 
Requires examination by immigration inspectors, in quarantine, of every alien employed on any vessel 
arriving from outside the United States, to determine: 
(1) Whether he is a bona fide seaman: If not, such seaman is to be removed and deported as an immi- 
grant, at the expense of (but not on) the vessel so bringing him; if he was originally shipped at a point in 
the United States, his return on the same vessel does not improve his right to remain in the United States; 
(2) Whether he is ineligible to citizenship: If so, alien members of the crew of foreign vessels are to be 
immediately removed and deported—except that vessels of a sovereign nation may bring in bona fide 
sea,men as members of their crew, (a) if subjects of such sovereign nation, regardless of ground of ineligi- 
bility (but if citizens of a colony, dependency or mandate or such nation, they must be not racially 
ineligible); (b) any person, regardless of citizenship, who is not racially excluded. 
Requires examination by Public Health Service surgeons to determine whether such alien is suffering 
from insanity, epilepsy, tuberculosis, etc.: If so, he is to be given hospital treatment at expense of vessel, 
in accordance with act of December 26, 1920 (U. S. C. 8:170). 
All vessels coming to United States with crews the majority of whom have been taken on abroad must 
carry a crew of at least equal number on departing from United States ports. 
Repeals § 20 of act of June 26, 1884 (U. S. C. 46:573) authorizing shipment of seamen abroad for 
vessels in foreign trade [cf. H. R. 5380].
