S. 397. Mr. King; January 7, 1935 (District of Columbia). 
As passed by Senate, January 10, and referred to House Committee on District of Columbia, January 11 
1935: 
Prescribes as condition to recording of deeds of trust in District of Columbia, that the notes secured 
must be identified by the recorder over his signature. 
Prescribes as to recording of releases: (1) That notes secured must be presented marked “paid”, and 
canceled—except that where a note is unavailable, an affidavit as to facts and bond to assure payment 
(or deposit of funds in registry of court) will be sufficient; (2) partial releases are authorized, upon satis- 
factory evidence of payment as required by the deed of trust (or assurance of payment as provided above); 
refusal by recorder in such case to be subject to review in equity; release may be recorded under court 
order in cases where a note-holder consents to release upon conditions not provided in the deed of trust; 
or where the conditions of release involve acts other than the payment of money. 
The act is not to apply to deeds of trust executed by public utilities, or to deeds where a bank is a 
trustee. In cases where a bank is a co-trustee, it shall become sole trustee upon the death of the indi- 
vidual trustee. 
Deeds authorizing redemption of notes by deposit of funds must name as depository a bank under 
Government supervision (which bank must signify its willingness to act); redemption by deposit to be 
made only after public notice.
